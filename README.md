## MBD-IE
Coding projects done during the Master Program in Big Data and Analytics at IE University in 2019 - 2020.

### BUSINESS ANALYTICS:
Data-Driven Business Strategies and ML models coded in Python:
  
#### Editorial X:
Extensive project competition to build a data driven business strategy for one of Spain's largest Publishing Companies. Main goals:
1. Design and implement a data cleaning process, ML pipeline and model that predicted the schools and classes that would stop using 
"standard" educational material and would start creating their own. Files: final_code.ipynb, ML_pipeline.ipynb, Technical Document.pdf
2. Design a nationwide business approach and sales strategy for customer acquisition, targetting potential customers that were predicted
in the previous step. Files: Business Strategy.pdf

#### HR Predicting Absenteeism:
Machine Learning pipeline including Feature Engineering and EDA, to predict absenteeism doing classification with Logistic Regression. The client being the HR department of a given company.


### KAGGLE:

Binary Text Classifier that decides if a given Tweet is a about a Real Disaster (1) or Not (0), making use of different 
NLP techniques, processes, libraries and algorithms. The pipeline I built is coded in Python, using mainly NLTK and Scikit-Learn. Steps:
EDA - Data Cleaning - Text Processing - Modelling

### SQL:
Designed and implemented a DB that replicated the structure and main components of the solar system. ERD designed in MySQL, and DB created using DDL and DML statements directly in DB2. Complex queries to answer specific questions using DQL statements in DB2 as well.


### Spark Streaming:
Snatch is a tool that allows companies to identify customer acquisition opportunities in real-time by analysing Twitter data. We spot your competitorsâ€™ unsatisfied customers and generate insights immediately, so that you can approach them in a timely manner. Tweets are ingested from Twitter's API, filtered and analyzed (sentiment analysis) using Spark Streaming and Spark SQL in real-time.
