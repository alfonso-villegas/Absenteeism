### MBD-IE
Coding projects done during the Master Program in Big Data and Analytics at IE University in 2019 - 2020.

#### - KAGGLE:

Build a Binary Text Classifier that decides if a given Tweet is a about a Real Disaster (1) or Not (0), making use of different 
NLP techniques, processes and libraries. The pipeline I built is coded in Python, using mainly NLTK and Scikit-Learn. Steps:
EDA - Data Cleaning - Text Processing - Modelling

#### - MACHINE LEARNING WITH PYTHON:
  
- Group X PROJECT:

Extensive project competition to build a data driven business strategy for one of Spain's largest Publishing Companies. Main goals:
1. Design and implement a data cleaning process, ML pipeline and model that predicted the schools and classes that would stop using 
"standard" educational material and would start creating their own. Files: final_code.ipynb, ML_pipeline.ipynb, Technical Document.pdf
2. Design a nationwide business approach and sales strategy for customer acquisition, targetting potential customers that were predicted
in the previous step. Files: Business Strategy.pdf
